Some tips on the use of GitHub

## [How to create a folder online on GitHub[reshipped]][1] [ How to use MarkDown][2]

1. Click the new Files button, and then enter the filename containing the slash character ("/"). That is, creating a file that contains a path (directory) that automatically produces a new folder.

2. Click on the Upload Files button and then drag the local folder (embedded file) directly into the batch upload.

**Note:** If you empty all the files in the folder, the folder disappears automatically.
